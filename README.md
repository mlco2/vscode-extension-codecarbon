-   Save your emissions data into a csv file for further analysis.

## Requirements

The extension uses `codecarbon` to measure the carbon emissions. This package connects to your hardware via specific APIs to get to know the power usage of your CPU/GPU/RAM. These APIs depend on the brand and OS. See https://mlco2.github.io/codecarbon/methodology.html#power-usage for the needed tools for your specific setup.

> Note: if you do not install the requirements, codecarbon will track in fallback mode.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

-   `codecarbon.launchOnStartup`: If true, the extension will start tracking the emissions when you open a new window. Defaults to true.
